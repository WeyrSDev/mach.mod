Base class for streams: File streams, ram streams, stdio streams, and the like. These classes possess only the most fundamental methods for interfacing with a stream. When actually reading from or writing to one of these streams, it will usually be preferable to wrap the stream in some StreamIO object, which will possess methods for abstracting more complex read/write functions in terms of the basic reading/writing functionality afforded by streams.
